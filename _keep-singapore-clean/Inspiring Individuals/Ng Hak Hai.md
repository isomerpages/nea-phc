<h3><strong>Pioneering a Cleaner Singapore</strong></h3>
<p>“You wouldn’t want your guests to enter your home when it’s messy, so
why would you want to leave the same impression for our tourists?” This
is the philosophy of Ng Hak Hai, a 64-year-old product manager and Chairman
of Nee Soon Clean and Green Community.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Driven by his passion to keep his community safe and healthy, Hak Hai
advocates for a cleaner Singapore by encouraging residents to be more conscious
of their environment. He believes that littering is not only an eyesore
but also creates breeding grounds for pests.</p>

<p>Hak Hai takes great pride in his estate, where the community actively
participates in clean-up activities in both their local neighbourhood and
beyond, including places such as Sungai Buloh and East Coast Park etc.
He recalls how volunteers from all walks of life, such as healthcare workers
and students, came together to contribute to the cause. “It is important
to instil a civic-minded mentality from a young age so that they can make
cleanliness part of their daily lives, helping to maintain a clean Singapore,”
he shares.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the introduction of SG Clean Day, where cleaners cease sweeping
in selected open areas in participating premises, the Nee Soon community
had initiated a No Cleaner Day on every 1 May. This not only gave cleaners
a well-deserved break but also instils ownership in residents to keep common
spaces clean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we celebrate SG60, Hak Hai hopes more Singaporeans will take pride
in our environment and take active steps to maintain a cleaner and more
hygienic environment.</p>
