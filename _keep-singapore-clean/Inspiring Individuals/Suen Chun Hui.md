<h2><strong>Cultivating kindred spirits for a cleaner Singapore</strong></h2>
<p>Suen Chun Hui, a 47-year-old software developer turned environmental advocate,
has always been passionate about keeping Singapore clean. Inspired by mentors
who taught him that even small actions can create big changes, he decided
to take his commitment one step further. In 2018, he founded Kindred Community
– a ground-up initiative that empowers people to take ownership of their
surroundings and actively contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable
Singapore.</p>

<p>What began as a personal quest has since grown into a community-led movement.
Kindred isn't just about picking up trash; it is about building habits,
raising awareness, and fostering a sense of camaraderie. Volunteers don’t
just clean — they bond over shared meals after clean-ups, explore neighbourhoods
together, and take part in appreciation events that make the experience
both enjoyable and fulfilling. “We keep things fun and social, because
we want people to come back and make this part of their lifestyle,” Chun
Hui says.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kindred organises both coastal and inland clean-ups, especially at Singapore’s
heartlands, where trash often hides in plain sight. “Singapore may appear
clean at first glance, but when you slow down and look deeper, you will
notice cigarette butts in the grass, tissues under benches, and bottle
caps scattered behind bushes”, he explains. “The litter is there. We have
just stopped seeing it. I call this ‘trash-blindness’.’’</p>

<p>One of his lasting memories was from a coastal clean-up session where
he and fellow volunteers found large discarded items, namely a washing
machine and a refrigerator, washed ashore. “If these were just the pieces
that surfaced, imagine what was hidden underwater,” he reflects. This eye-opening
moment revealed the scale of ocean waste, and deepened his motivation to
inspire more Singaporeans to step up.</p>
