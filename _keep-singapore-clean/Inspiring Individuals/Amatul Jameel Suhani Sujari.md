<h3><strong>Beyond the Classroom:&nbsp; A Teacher's Passion for a Cleaner Singapore</strong></h3>
<p>Inspired by Singapore's reputation as a clean and green city, 57-year-old
teacher Mdm Suhani is committed to preserving its pristine image. Her dedication
extends beyond her HDB flat and classrooms into the heart of her community.</p>
<p>Her journey began when she participated in a school-organised beach clean-up.
This experience ignited a passion for public cleanliness and a strong sense
of accountability. She firmly believes that "public cleanliness is a shared
responsibility we should not take for granted," and hopes to encourage
others to join the cause.</p>

<p>As an active member and vice-president of the Dakota Breeze Resident Network
(RN), Mdm Suhani frequently organises public cleaning activities involving
schools, volunteers and fellow RN members. The installation of the Public
Hygiene Council's CleanPod - a litter-picking tool sharing platform - in
her estate has further empowered the community. Neighbours, many of whom
had never volunteered before, are now taking the initiative to clean up
the area with the easily accessible shared equipment.</p>

<p>The Dakota Breeze RN members also showed gratitude to volunteers and estate
cleaners by organising bi-annual meals for everyone to enjoy and mingle.
Mdm Suhani mentioned that these gestures of appreciation give volunteers
and estate cleaners a sense of pride and belonging in keeping public spaces
clean.</p>
<p>When asked about her fond memories of this rewarding journey, Mdm Suhani
shared her reassurance about the future generation. She believes that parents
and schools have instilled a stronger sense of civic mindedness in the
children when it comes to caring for the environment and maintaining public
cleanliness.&nbsp; Mdm Suhani fondly recalled two young brothers in her
neighbourhood picking up what they called 'treasures' - a creative perspective
instilled by their parents.</p>
<p>"Every small effort counts in upholding Singapore's Garden City status,"
she said, urging individuals to embrace their role in keeping our public
spaces clean and green.</p>
<p>Mdm Suhani’s unwavering belief in collective action reminds us that it
is not just individual efforts, but the shared commitment of the community,
that ensures Singapore’s cleanliness endures.</p>
