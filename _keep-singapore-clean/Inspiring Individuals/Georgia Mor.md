<h3><strong>Small actions, big impact!</strong></h3>
<p>An inspiring motto that Ms Georgia Mor, founder of One Planet Singapore,
lives by is: “If you do something small many, many times, and get others
to help you, you can make a big difference.”</p>
<p>A sustainability advocate and former accountant, Georgia moved to Singapore
from Australia with her family six years ago. Compelled by her passion
for the environment, Georgia has organised over 140 clean-ups, clearing
a whopping 16 tonnes of rubbish off our streets and shores.</p>
<p>It all started with a holiday trip to Bintan. Georgia was dismayed to
find a dirty and littered coastline, a far cry from the pristine white
sandy beach she was expecting.</p>
<p>Despite not having an environmental background, she felt that she needed
to do something about it.</p>

</p>
<p>Upon her return to Singapore, she spoke with a friend and realised that
they had both spent time during holidays cleaning up beaches. With both
living in Holland Village, they began meeting up once in a while to clean
up their neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Soon, they realised that they needed to expand their efforts, as it would
take a lot more than two people to make a significant impact. They began
sharing their clean-up adventures on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/OnePlanetSingapore/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/one_planet_singapore/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, and invited friends to join them in their activities. Their
passion project grew steadily as more and more people joined in their clean-up
efforts.</p>

</p>
<p>Georgia also sets an example at home, involving her children - aged 15
and 17 years old - in her clean-up endeavours, to instil in them the values
of environmental conservation and community responsibility.</p>
<p>Her passion for environmental cleanliness and litter picking is not limited
to beaches. Georgia’s habit of picking up litter on the street has earned
her a good reputation among her neighbours, and her absence is felt whenever
she is out of town!</p>
<p>Georgia’s journey in public cleanliness and her continued efforts highlight
the extensive impact of collective action. With 2024 designated as the
Year of Public Hygiene, Georgia hopes that more will be inspired to step
forward and make a difference to our living environment. By starting small
and enlisting the help of the community, she has demonstrated how consistent
efforts can lead to significant change.</p>
