<h3><strong>Rallying the community for a cleaner neighbourhood</strong></h3>
<p>Meet Johny Tan, a 39-year-old healthcare administrator and the Chairman
for Boon Lay Zone D Residents’ Network. Driven by a deep passion for the
well-being of residents, particularly the elderly and vulnerable, Johny
observed a correlation between a clean environment and better health. He
envisioned a cleaner, healthier estate for all, and thus, the Boon Lay
Clean-up Project was born - an initiative that invites everyone, from children
to seniors, to pitch in and help keep the estate clean.</p>

<p>What began as a small initiative has blossomed into a vibrant community
movement. Every month, residents of all ages and backgrounds join hands
to make a difference. To facilitate their regular community clean-ups,
the Public Hygiene Council will be setting up a CleanPod, a litter-picking
tool-sharing platform, in the estate. To add a creative touch to their
collective effort, the residents of Boon Lay will be decorating their own
CleanPod, transforming it into a vibrant piece of community art.</p>

<p>As Singaporeans, we often sing the lyrics of ‘One People, One Nation,
One Singapore’ with pride during National Day. But Johny believes true
pride comes from taking responsibility. “Every creed and every race, has
its role and has its place,” as the lyrics state, he says, urging us all
to do our part in maintaining the cleanliness of our shared places – not
just leaving it to cleaners but actively participating in keeping our community
clean and healthy.</p>
