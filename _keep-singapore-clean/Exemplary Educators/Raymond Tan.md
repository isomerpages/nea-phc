<p>Seventeen-year-old Rubeus Tan founded <em>Basketball Société Courageuse</em>,
a recreational basketball team, to give youths like himself the opportunity
to enjoy the sport outside of school. He roped in his father, Raymond Tan,
45, to sponsor the team and double up as a youth mentor, guiding the team
of 15 players to be responsible young adults through basketball and to
excel at what they enjoy. What began as an avenue to quench their thirst
for the sport soon transformed into an initiative that fosters environmental
and social responsibility among youths.</p>

<p>The name <em>Société Courageuse</em> reflects the team’s deeper values.
“I wanted it to be a safe space where kids can play freely without fear
– to have the courage to be themselves and not let fear hold them back.
Many of these boys are judged by grades, but here, they learn that their
worth isn’t defined by academics alone,” Raymond shared. He added that
this same courage extends beyond the court and school life, empowering
the youths to stand up for what is right, even in small acts like keeping
their surroundings clean. The team’s core values originate from a multi-generational
journey of civic-mindedness and an innate sense of responsibility for our
environment – values passed down from father to son. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Raymond’s commitment to cleanliness stems from his upbringing. His father,
a humble ice-cream seller, would sweep the surroundings and pick up litter
without hesitation. He instilled and nurtured this sense of environmental
responsibility in Raymond, making it his second nature. As a young rugby
player, he led by example, cleaning up after matches and encouraging teammates
to do the same. "Cleanliness is in my DNA," Raymond said. reflecting on
how he has since passed down his father’s teachings to his own son. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today, Rubeus’ team also initiates litter-picking activities after every
game, leaving the court cleaner than when they stepped in. For him, this
came naturally – an instinct shaped by years of watching his father’s example.
Rubeus’ cleanliness efforts soon caught on, with the rest of the team joining
in, exemplifying how one small action can have a ripple effect and inspire
others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Taking ownership of my surroundings came naturally to me. Since childhood,
my father has taught me to be environmentally conscious through simple
actions, from returning trays after meals to never littering, my teammates
also do it willingly with no questions asked,” said Rubeus. He emphasised
that education starts at home, with parents playing an impactful role in
teaching our shared responsibility for a clean and hygienic Singapore.
Our children are the future of tomorrow, and the ball is now in their court
to continue keeping Singapore clean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Singapore commemorates SG60, Raymond and Rubeus hope the nation continues
its legacy as a clean and green city.&nbsp; “Did we mention that Mr Lee
Kuan Yew is our role model? My Grandpa, my dad and me, “said Rubeus with
a grin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cleanliness isn’t just a habit - it’s a part of the Singapore identity,
part of our DNA. And with every piece of trash picked up and every court
left spotless, the Tans prove that the simplest actions can build a lasting
legacy.</p>
