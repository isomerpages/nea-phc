<p><strong>Passing It On: A Multi-Generational Legacy of Cleanliness</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Seventeen-year-old Rubeus Tan founded <em>Basketball Société Courageuse</em>,
a recreational basketball team, to give youths like himself the opportunity
to enjoy the sport outside of school. He roped in his father, Raymond Tan,
45, to sponsor the team and double up as a youth mentor, guiding the team
of 15 players to be responsible young adults through basketball and to
excel at what they enjoy. What began as an avenue to quench their thirst
for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the sport</a> soon
transformed into an initiative that fosters environmental and social responsibility
among youths.</p>
