<h4><strong>About the Competition</strong></h4>
<p>Singapore generated 6.86 million tonnes of waste in 2023. This is not
sustainable, and it is imperative for each one of us to adopt an eco-friendly
lifestyle. Our youths are the future custodians of our environment; thus,
it is important for us to inculcate the civic-mindedness and the right
values in them.</p>
<p>In partnership with the Ministry of Education (MOE) - Character &amp;
Citizenship Education Branch and J.O.E (Just One Earth) Eco Alliance, the
Public Hygiene Council (PHC) is pleased to organise the third run of its
nationwide competition: <em>Bulky Waste to Wonder Competition 2025</em>â€™.
The competition has been designed to provide opportunities for youths to
rethink the use of bulky waste and showcase their ideas by redesigning
and/or repurposing used bulky furniture into functional items.</p>
<p>We hope that through their creativity and imagination, our youths can
inspire others to think twice before disposing of bulky waste that may
still be useful. This will help us to achieve a more sustainable lifestyle,
and progress towards maintaining a truly clean and hygienic Singapore.</p>
