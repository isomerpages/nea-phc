<h1>Bulky Waste to Wonder Competition 2024</h1>
<h3>About the Competition</h3>
<p>Singapore generated 7.39 million tonnes of waste in 2022. This is not
sustainable, and it is imperative for every one of us to adopt an eco-friendlier
lifestyle. Our youths are the future custodians of our environment and
hence it is even more critical to inculcate the civic-mindedness and cultivate
the right values in them.</p>
<p>In partnership with the Ministry of Education (MOE) – Character &amp;
Citizenship Education Branch and J.O.E (Just One Earth) Eco Alliance, the
Public Hygiene Council (PHC) is pleased to organise a nation-wide competition
titled ‘<em>Bulky Waste to Wonder Competition 2024</em>’. It has been designed
to provide opportunities for youths to rethink the use of bulky waste and
showcase their ideas by redesigning and/or repurposing used bulky furniture
into functional items. We hope that through the youths’ creativity and
imagination, they can inspire others to think twice before dumping their
bulky waste items. This will help us to achieve a more sustainable lifestyle
and progress towards maintaining a truly clean and hygienic Singapore.</p>
<h3>Open to</h3>
<p>All secondary school students, option to participate as an individual
or in group of max 3 pax.</p>
