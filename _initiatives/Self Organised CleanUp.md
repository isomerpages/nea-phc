<p>Clean-up is a good way to demonstrate our support for a clean and hygienic
environment. Through participating in clean-ups, we can better understand
the importance of keeping our shared spaces clean. Clean-up can also be
a fun and engaging activity for children to learn about environmentalism.</p>
<p><strong>Suggested steps for the clean-up activity:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Identify when and where you would like to conduct
your clean-up activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Invite your friends and family members to join
you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Get ready tongs and trash bags. Alternatively,
you may wish to borrow litter-picking tools from a <a href="/resources/cleanpod/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CleanPod</a> near you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Before the clean-up, brief your friends/family/participants
on the dos and don'ts, and safety guidelines to note for the activity.
Remind them to stay hydrated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>After the clean-up, take a group photo with the
trash collected. Post the photo on your social media account and hashtag
#KeepSGClean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Dispose of all trash collected in the available
bins nearest to you.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You may organise your own clean-up activity in the housing estates or
at parks and beaches. For clean-ups at parks and beaches, you may wish
to register your activity with us <a href="/beachcleanup/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Remember: Safety First! Watch out for inclement weather or possible dangerous items on the ground like sharp objects. Stop the activity if you are not feeling well.</strong>
