<h3>SG Clean Day</h3>
<p>The Public Hygiene Council designated 25 April 2021 as the inaugural SG
Clean Day in partnership with all 17 Town Councils. Scheduled to be held
quarterly, all Town Councils and partners will cease sweeping at selected
areas of participating housing estates, public parks, attractions, reservoirs,
shopping malls, transport nodes for a day with the aim of showing what
the amount of litter there will be when we go without cleaners. This also
helps us appreciate our cleaners more.</p>
<p>The upcoming bimonthly SG Clean Day will be held on Sunday, 23 Feb, 13
Apr, 29 Jun, 31 Aug, 26 Oct and 28 Dec 2025, and new partners will be part
of this initiative by ceasing cleaning at selected areas of public spaces.
All 17 town councils, more than 300 public parks and park connectors under
NParks, Public Utilities Board’s (PUB) Marina Barrage, ABC Water Sites
and Reservoir Parks, the transport operators, Active SG Sport Centres and
PA’s Integrated Hubs. Selected public spaces of Dormitories Association
Singapore Limited (DASL) migrant workers’ dormitories, major tourist attractions
(Gardens by the Bay, Mandai Wildlife Group, Resorts World and Sentosa),
selected malls from CapitaLand Investment, City Developments Ltd (CDL),
Far East Organisation, Frasers Property Singapore, Hongkong Land, Lendlease

of Fine Arts (NAFA), National Heritage Board &nbsp;(NHB), Singapore Chinese
Orchestra (SCO), STPI and PA Integrated Community Hubs will cease sweeping

by binning their trash or organising a clean-up in your neighbourhood.</p>
