<h3>Neighbourhood Toilets Community Group (NTCG)</h3>
<p>The Neighbourhood Toilets Community Group (NTCG) aims to inculcate a collective
ownership of the cleanliness at public toilets. By bring together key stakeholders,
the operators and community volunteers, NTCG seeks to promote a culture
of joint responsibility of operators and the community to keep public toilets
clean.</p>
<p>Working closely with the premises operators, the community volunteers
will monitor the cleanliness of the toilets as well as report whether amenities,
such as the flushing systems, dryers, soap dispensers and tissue rolls,
are in working condition. They will also actively engage users to remind
them of the need to keep the toilets clean.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The premises owners will also do their part by stepping up on their cleaning
regime, to provide a clean toilet for the users. Interested community groups
may email us <a href="mailto:ask@publichygienecouncil.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">atask@publichygienecouncil.sg</a>&nbsp;for
more information on the initiative.</p>
