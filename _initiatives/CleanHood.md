<p>The Public Hygiene Council (PHC)’s <strong>‘CleanHood’ programme</strong> -
formerly known<em> </em>as the ‘Sustainable Bright Spot’ programme – is
expanding its reach beyond residential areas to forge <strong>new partnerships with schools</strong>  <strong>and local community businesses</strong>.
This enhanced long-term initiative will not only cultivate ownership amongst
residents to upkeep the cleanliness of their neighbourhoods, but will further <strong>create a broader network</strong> by
bringing together residents, students and merchants, as cleanliness advocates.</p>
<p>The CleanHood programme aims to create a <strong>strong ecosystem of stakeholders who actively maintain their shared common spaces</strong>,
through participation in community events and regular clean-up activities.
It is a <strong>community-driven initiative</strong>, where participating
estates spearhead and coordinate activities that unite residents, schools,
and businesses, in fostering awareness of public cleanliness issues and
promoting collective responsibility. This will <strong>strengthen community bonds</strong> while
creating a sustainable, clean and liveable environment.</p>
<p><strong><u>CleanHood At Schools</u></strong>
<br>2025 marks the <strong>introduction of the CleanHood programme to schools</strong> –
a strategic move to <strong>cultivate public cleanliness habits among our youths</strong>.
By integrating PHC’s initiative with MOE’s Values-in-Action (VIA) programme,
students can take the lead in KSC initiatives while gaining valuable leadership
experience and contributing to their VIA hours.</p>
<p>PHC’s focus on developing <strong>student environmental cleanliness and hygiene champions</strong> aims
to build a strong foundation comprising young leaders who will shape Singapore’s
public cleanliness culture for years to come. Their ground-up initiatives
will not only transform school environments, but will also inspire wider
community action.</p>
