<p>Thank you for expressing interest in helping with the tar ball clean-up
at the reopened beaches at East Coast Park.</p>
<p>The earlier phases focused on removing oil slicks and contaminated sand
from the surface of affected beaches, as well as difficult to clean areas
such as rock bunds, breakwaters, and oil trapped deeper in the sand.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need Your Help With</strong>
</p>
<p>The majority of the clean-up efforts have been completed. What remains
are some tar balls and oil-stained marine litter and debris, which continue
to be washed ashore.</p>

<p>We need your help to remove these residual tar balls - small, dark-coloured
pieces of coagulated oil.</p>
<p>The task will involve walking sections of the beach near the tide lines,
wearing gloves, long pants and covered shoes for protection. Using rakes
and tongs, volunteers will deposit the tar balls and other debris into
trash bags, before bringing them to demarcated areas for disposal.</p>
