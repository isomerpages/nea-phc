<p>We strongly encourage you to bring your own tongs and trash bags (reuse
grocery bags) for the clean-up. Alternatively, you may borrow litter-picking
tools from our CleanPods at East Coast Park C4 and F2. These two CleanPods
will be opened that day to facilitate this ground-up effort for National
Day.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Identify where and when you wish to conduct your
clean-up. You have East Coast Park Area B, D, E, F and G to choose from.
Set a time. You may conduct your clean-up anytime between 9am and 6pm.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Invite your friends and family members to join
you. Remind them to bring their own litter-picking tools.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> On the event day, brief your participants on the
parameters and safety guidelines before the clean-up. Remind them to stay
hydrated.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>After the clean-up, take a group photo with the
trash collected. Post them on your social media and hashtag #NDCleanUp
to nudge those around you to keep Singapore clean.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Dispose of the trash into the existing bins and
thank everyone for their participation!</p>
