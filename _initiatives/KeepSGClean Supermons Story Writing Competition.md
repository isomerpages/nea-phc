<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Good habits start from young. It is therefore important to raise awareness
on public hygiene and cleanliness and to instil civic-mindedness in young
children at their early age. Good personal hygiene habits will keep them
away from viruses and bacteria, and will follow them in their life journey.
Our youths are the future custodians of our environment and it is even
more critical to cultivate the right values in them.</p>
<p>In partnership with the Temasek Polytechnic (TP) and National Institute
of Early Childhood (NIEC), the Public Hygiene Council (PHC) is pleased
to organise the KeepSGClean Supermons Story Writing Competition in 2024.
It has been designed to provide opportunities for youths to creative impactful
stories to encourage and instil good habits in our young minds. This will
help us to achieve a more sustainable lifestyle and progress towards maintaining
a truly clean and hygienic Singapore.</p>
