<p>The Corporate Action Network (CAN), established by the Public Hygiene
Council (PHC), was launched in April 2024. It represents a coalition of
corporate organisations and businesses committed to driving corporate-led
activities in conjunction with the PHC to support the Keep Singapore Clean
movement, and to leading the change towards a clean and healthy environment
for all. Members of CAN share the PHC’s vision of working together to create
a culture where everyone holds the deeply held value of Keeping Singapore
Clean.</p>
<p>Each CAN member shall nominate corporate representatives to attend meetings
organised by the PHC. The meetings will serve as a platform for CAN members
to network, share best practices, and explore opportunities to collaborate
in building a culture of collective responsibility in keeping Singapore
clean. The PHC will also provide capability support to CAN members where
feasible to facilitate the implementation of ground-up initiatives, develop
systems and tools to track and provide a more comprehensive overview of
CAN’s nationwide efforts. CAN members are also encouraged to participate
in PHC’s ongoing initiatives.</p>
<p>The PHC will publish CAN member initiatives on various media platforms
to amplify the Keep Singapore Clean message to the wider community.</p>
