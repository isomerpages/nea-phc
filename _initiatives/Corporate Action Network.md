<p>The Corporate Action Network (C.A.N.), established by the Public Hygiene
Council (PHC), was launched in April 2024. It represents a coalition of
corporate organisations and businesses committed to driving corporate-led
activities in conjunction with the PHC to support the Keep Singapore Clean
movement, and to leading the change towards a clean and healthy environment
for all. Members of C.A.N. share the PHC’s vision of working together to
create a culture where everyone holds the deeply held value of Keeping
Singapore Clean.</p>
<p>Each C.A.N. member shall nominate corporate representatives to attend
meetings organised by the PHC. The meetings will serve as a platform for
C.A.N. members to network, share best practices, and explore opportunities
to collaborate in building a culture of collective responsibility in keeping
Singapore clean. The PHC will also provide capability support to C.A.N.
members where feasible to facilitate the implementation of ground-up initiatives,
develop systems and tools to track and provide a more comprehensive overview
of C.A.N.’s nationwide efforts. C.A.N. members are also encouraged to participate
in PHC’s ongoing initiatives.</p>
<p>The PHC will publish C.A.N. member initiatives on various media platforms
to amplify the Keep Singapore Clean message to the wider community.</p>
