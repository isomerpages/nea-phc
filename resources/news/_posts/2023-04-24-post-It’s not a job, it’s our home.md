<p>Singapore has long been known as one of the cleanest cities in the world.
We have come a long way since the early days of our nation, where we faced
environmental challenges such as litter strewn streets, polluted waterways
and poor public sanitation.</p>
<p>Today, we enjoy clean air, pristine waterways that run through our little
island, and spotlessly clean streets.</p>
<p>However, if we were to take a closer look, we would know that we are not
truly clean after all. It is not difficult to find errant litter hiding
under the bushes, badly littered neighbourhoods in the wee hours of the
morning, and dirty public toilets.</p>
<p>With more than 59,000 cleaners cleaning after us, it is easy to deduce
that we have started to delegate the responsibility in keeping Singapore
clean to the cleaners. We have lost the sense of responsibility in keeping
public spaces clean.</p>
<p>We need to recognise that Singapore is our home. We do not litter at home,
and neither do we leave our toilets at home in poorly maintained conditions.
It is time we recognise that our home goes beyond the four walls we wake
up to every morning.</p>
<p>Our home extends beyond our doorstep. Our home is where we meet our friends
for a hearty meal; it is the park where we enjoy a lovely evening stroll;
it is the bus-stop where we catch the bus to work; it is the neighbourhood
gym where we visit for a good workout.</p>
<p>All these places make up the special place we call home. It is our responsibility
to keep Singapore, our home, clean.</p>
