<p><strong>These quintessentially Singaporean values have been put to the test during Covid-19, when good public hygiene practice can be a matter of life and death.</strong>
</p>
<p>It hits me every time I step off the plane: the sudden chill of full-blast
air con and the distinct scent of orchid-tea fragrance diffuser. Airports
can feel nondescript, but arriving at Changi – both today and long before
the Covid-19 pandemic – is a uniquely Singaporean experience. On the way
to passport control, walking through the perfumed air, you'll see immaculately
kempt green walls and tidy water features, teams of janitorial staff (in
both human and robot form) and high-tech washrooms with interactive feedback
screens.</p>
<p>If you leave the airport expecting the rest of the city to be this orderly
and clean, you won't be disappointed. Once <strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/10/weekinreview/the-world-singapore-the-tiger-whose-teeth-are-not-universally-scorned.html" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>described by the New York Times</u></a></strong> as
a place "so clean that bubble gum is a controlled substance", Singapore
is universally known for its perfectly paved roads, manicured public parks,
and spotless, litter-free streets.</p>
<p>ut cleanliness is more than a merely aesthetic ideal here. In this small
city-state with just under 56 years of national independence under its
belt, cleanliness has been synonymous with major social progress, unprecedented
economic growth and, most recently, <strong><a href="https://covid19.who.int/region/wpro/country/sg" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>a coordinated containment of the coronavirus pandemic</u></a></strong>.</p>
<p>While Singaporeans themselves tend to humbly shrug off the suggestion
their country is especially clean, its leaders have done everything they
can to procure and maintain a pristine public image. "Singapore's clean
reputation is something the government consciously sought to promote,"
explained Donald Low, a Singaporean academic and public policy scholar.
"Originally, that cleanliness had at least two connotations: the first
was physical, or environmental, cleanliness; the second was a clean government
and society that didn't tolerate corruption.</p>

</p>
<p>Having separated from Malaysia in 1965, Singapore, led by then-prime minister
Lee Kuan Yew, had lofty ambitions of becoming a "first-world oasis in a
third-world region", as he termed it. "As a newly independent city-state
that was keen to attract foreign investments, Lee Kuan Yew believed, correctly,
that these things would differentiate Singapore from the rest of South-East
Asia," Low explained.</p>
<p>In practical terms, achieving cleanliness meant developing quality sewage
systems, creating programmes to combat dengue and disease, a decade-long
cleanup of the heavily polluted Singapore River, island-wide tree planting
and the transition of once-ubiquitous street food vendors into covered
hawker centres.</p>
<p>It also meant enacting a multitude of nationwide public hygiene campaigns
appealing to Singapore's citizens to do their part. "Keeping the community
clean requires a people conscious of their responsibilities," proclaimed
Lee at the 1968 inauguration of <strong><a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/programmes-grants/campaigns/keep-sg-clean-movement" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Keep Singapore Clean</u></a></strong>,
a now annual anti-littering initiative. Lee's speech sought to arouse a
new sense of national pride among Singaporeans, appealing to a collectivist,
communitarian spirit that he saw as vital to achieving the nation's goals.</p>
<p>As the city-state's environmental conditions improved, so did Singapore's
appeal to foreign investors and tourists alike, ushering in an extended
period of unprecedented economic growth. These days, Singapore regularly
tops polls ranking social conditions, such as personal safety and quality
of living, among global cities; while its highly developed free market
economy ranks as one of the most competitive on the planet.</p>
<p>Nowhere feels more emblematic of the nation's modern-day vigour than its
Central Business District, where shiny, sky-scraping office towers – home
to thousands of international headquarters – sit beside world-class luxury
hotels, including the iconic Moshe Safdie-designed <strong><a href="https://www.marinabaysands.com/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Marina Bay Sands</u></a></strong>.
It's the kind of futuristic utopia that its founding prime minister could
have only dreamed of.</p>
<p>It irked Lee that, despite his country's achievements, he'd somehow always
be asked about the notorious chewing gum ban during interviews with foreign
media. It's unlikely that he foresaw the level of global attention it would
elicit when enacting the law in 1992 to combat the expense of cleaning
pre-chewed gum from public places, like the then-brand new MRT (public
transport) system. These days, gum consumption is, in fact, permitted –
if you happen to inadvertently smuggle a half-eaten packet in your luggage
here you won't be thrown in jail – but its sale remains prohibited.</p>
<p>Low explains that the infamous gum law is actually quite anomalous in
terms of Singapore policy making. "Rather than outright bans," he explained,
"the Singapore government usually resorts to financial (dis)incentives
for activities that generate costs for society," citing by way of example <strong><a href="https://theaseanpost.com/article/singapores-carbon-tax-what-does-it-entail" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>its recent introduction of a carbon tax</u></a></strong>,
designed to curb emissions and encourage clean energy alternatives.</p>
<p>But, I wondered, can Singapore really be as clean as its reputation suggests?
It goes without saying that the gleaming skyscrapers, boat-shaped hotels
and man-made water features don't paint an accurate picture of everyday
life here. Yet even when I went outside of the city's downtown centre and
into the parts where tourists seldom venture, its uniformly designed public
housing estates, neatly groomed public parks, scrupulously regulated hawker
centres were far from unclean.</p>
<p>I headed to Geylang, an area of Singapore famous for its excellent local
food (Anthony Bourdain experienced "pure messy indulgence" eating <em>crab bee hoon</em> here
in 2001) and for being the only legalised red-light district in the city.
Surely, I thought, this is where I'd see the "real" Singapore.</p>
<p>It was after dark and the streets were aglow with dated-looking fluorescent-neon
signs advertising sex shops, karaoke lounges and late-night cafes selling
frog-leg porridge, a regional delicacy. "Think of this as the underbelly
of Singapore," said Cai Yinzhou, standing beside me in a dimly lit alley,
"the opposite to the manicured skyscrapers we see in the Central Business
District."</p>
<p>Yinzhou, a Geylang native, who "grew up with sex workers and gambling
den-operators for neighbours", now runs <strong><a href="https://www.citizenadventures.com/geylang-adventures" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Geylang Adventures</u></a></strong>,
an organised tour that aims to "present Geylang as a social ecosystem,
beyond the seedy or delicious side that most locals know it to be," he
told me.</p>
<p>Yinzhou's tour explores Geylang's brothels, bars and social milieu, which
often seem at odds with Singapore's strait-laced reputation. Despite its
incongruity within an otherwise family-friendly city, Geylang didn't feel
dangerous. Nor remotely lawless. With close to 500 security cameras spanning
the neighbourhood, there was an overwhelming sense that its unruly elements
– from vice to drugs – were being carefully contained and "frequently swept
clean", as Yinzhou described it.</p>
<p>"This is the real Singapore", a Singaporean in our tour group declared,
"it should be on every tourist checklist." I found myself agreeing. Although
Geylang didn't feel sterile, it did ultimately fit, in its own unique way,
into Singapore's national narrative of a clean, uncorrupt society.</p>
<p>These quintessentially Singaporean values were truly put to the test last
year.</p>
<p>Not since Lee's impassioned campaigns of the late 1960s has the topic
of cleanliness felt as pertinent as it does in this current era. In a world
that's been radically redefined by the Covid-19 crisis, good public hygiene
practice can be a matter of life and death.</p>
<p>On the world stage, <strong><a href="https://safe.menlosecurity.com/https://theconversation.com/why-singapores-coronavirus-response-worked-and-what-we-can-all-learn-134024" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Singapore's response to the coronavirus is one that has been widely lauded</u></a></strong>.
But unlike most nations, Singapore's handling of the pandemic hasn't been
purely reactive. The nation's advanced public hygiene infrastructure meant
that in many ways Singapore was already prepared.</p>
<p>"We trained our officers in how to deal with the disinfection of infectious
diseases even before Covid-19 hit our shores," explained Tai Ji Choong,
Director of the Division of Public Cleanliness at Singapore's National
Environment Agency. Having designed a course with Singapore Polytechnic
in 2017, Choong tells me that staff were "equipped with updated skills
and knowledge in disinfection techniques, disinfectant handling, safety
procedures and the correct use of personal protective equipment in dealing
with an infectious disease outbreak in Singapore, which proved critical
when we were notified of the first Covid-19 case last year".</p>
<p>That played out in an effective rollout of public health tech solutions:
mobile apps that allow citizens to acquire face masks; smart thermal scanning
technologies to monitor body temperatures in large groups; and <strong><a href="https://safe.menlosecurity.com/https://www.bbc.com/news/av/technology-52619568" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self"><u>robot dogs that patrol public parks</u></a></strong> to
enforce social distancing measures.</p>
<p>While effective governance has been crucial in handling the virus, the
pandemic has inevitably forced leaders to ask a lot of their citizens.
In Singapore, where mask-wearing and contact tracing are mandatory, the
response from its people has been overwhelmingly compliant.</p>
<p>But then, in a society with a cultural legacy of cleanliness, where prescriptive
public hygiene policy and community coordination are the norm, what else
would you expect?</p>
