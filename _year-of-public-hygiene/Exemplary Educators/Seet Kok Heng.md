<h1>A dedicated family man and community leader</h1>

</p>
<p>His volunteering journey began nine years ago with his wife, at Jalan
Kayu Residents’ Network. With some free time on his hands, Kok Heng decided
to sign up as a volunteer, not realising that this would spark a lasting
commitment with his family to volunteering.</p>
<p>Today, Kok Heng is an active Grassroots Leader and the Organising Chair
for Jalan Kayu’s Community Food Rescue, an initiative that distributes
food that is near expiry to those who need it.</p>
<p>He also serves as an advisor at the <a href="a member of the Public Hygiene Council (PHC)’s R.I.S.E Champions Network" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Lions Club of Singapore Mandarin</a>,
a member of the Public Hygiene Council (PHC)’s R.I.S.E Champions Network.
Previously holding the position of District Chairperson from 2019 to 2022,
he continues to act as the liaison between the Lions Club and the Public
Hygiene Council (PHC).</p>
<p>One of his proudest achievements at the Club is spearheading the National
Day litter-free outreach initiative at Marina Bay. In partnership with
PHC since 2016, this project involves volunteers proactively engaging the
public to clean up after themselves during the National Day fireworks event,
and rewarding those who do so with small tokens of appreciation.</p>
<p>Initially requiring more than 100 volunteers, the initiative now needs
only about 30 volunteers per activation, as more members of the public
have internalised the message of personal responsibility in keeping public
spaces clean.</p>
<p>“It’s heartening to see how the message has been accepted. Nowadays, we
see more and more people cleaning up after themselves,” Kok Heng shares
proudly.</p>
<p>Kok Heng also makes it a point to bring his family along for the activities.
He believes that it is a good opportunity to inculcate good values and
educate his child on environmental issues.</p>
<p>Volunteering has also helped his child to come out of his shell: “Ethan
used to be very shy, but he started opening up at volunteering sessions
at the beach, making friends with kids of his age.”</p>
<p>This exposure has led the 8-year-old to become more passionate about environmental
responsibility, often picking up trash and disposing of it properly even
outside of litter picking sessions.</p>

</p>
<p>Looking forward, Mr Seet is excited about a new project with PHC that
involves surveying the cleanliness of coffeeshop toilets and providing
recommendations for improvement. His dedication to family and community
exemplifies leadership, compassion, and a commitment to leaving a positive
legacy. Mr Seet believes in maintaining a clean country for future generations,
and inspiring others through his actions and values.</p>
<p>With 2024 designated as the Year of Public Hygiene, Seet Kok Heng hopes
that his efforts in community service will inspire others to embrace the
values of dedication and responsibility.
<br>
<br>By encouraging active participation in volunteerism and instilling these
values in the next generation, Mr Seet aims to foster a culture of care
and cleanliness, ensuring that Singapore remains a thriving, well-maintained
home for all.disposing of it properly even outside of litter picking sessions.</p>
