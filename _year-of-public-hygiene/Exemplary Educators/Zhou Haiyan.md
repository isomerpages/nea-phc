<h1>Inspiring sustainability through creativity, one community at a time</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"While changing the world can be challenging, we can all do our part by
altering our lifestyles. If everyone comes together with the same commitment,
we can create a better place for our planet.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>This belief is at the heart of Zhou Haiyan's mission. Since arriving in
Singapore 15 years ago, she has immersed herself in environmental volunteer
activities, convinced that everyone, regardless of background, has a role
to play in conservation and that even the smallest actions can have a profound
impact.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As Chairperson of Just One Solution (JOS), an office furniture company,
and the non-profit organisation <a href="https://www.joeecoalliance.com/en/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Just One Earth (J.O.E.) Eco Alliance</a>,
which focuses on environmental conservation, Haiyan has made sustainability
a cornerstone of her life and work.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Her commitment was sparked by the potential threat of rising sea levels
to Singapore, leading her to volunteer with the Tzu Chi Foundation. For
the past decade, she has dedicated herself to educating young minds about
environmental stewardship.</p>

<p>Haiyan’s vision aligns with that of the Public Hygiene Council (PHC),
prompting her to partner with PHC and the Ministry of Education to launch
the "Bulky Waste to Wonder" competition. This innovative programme challenges
students to transform discarded furniture into functional and artistic
pieces, fostering creativity and environmental consciousness.</p>

<p>During the competition, students participated in a design workshop at
the JOS &amp; Sunon Sustainability Experience Centre, where they learnt
from experienced designers. Haiyan shared that the students not only gained
valuable guidance but also inspired the designers with their fresh ideas
and enthusiasm, fostering a mutual exchange that enhances creativity and
confidence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With 2024 designated as the Year of Public Hygiene, Haiyan emphasises
that while our efforts may not yield immediate results, we can all take
small, meaningful steps. If everyone believes their actions are insignificant,
nothing will change. But if we, like Haiyan, strive to make a difference,
we can collectively drive impactful change.</p>
