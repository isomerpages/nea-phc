<p>Sanjay Mundhra is passionate about keeping Singapore clean.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every fortnight, the spry 56-year-old Account Support Manager at Hewlett
Packard Enterprise goes on patrols with fellow volunteers at littering
hotspots, such as Chinatown and Orchard Road, to remind the public to bin
their trash properly and return their food trays after meals at public
eateries.</p>
<p>He also organises regular litter-picking activities and hosts community
talks, to spread awareness on the importance of keeping our environment
clean.</p>

<p>Sanjay’s journey as an advocate for public cleanliness started in 2016,
when he realised how much Singaporeans – including himself – rely on the
cleaning workforce to clean up after us. He felt strongly that it should
not be the sole responsibility of cleaners to maintain the cleanliness
of our streets and other public spaces in Singapore.</p>
<p>That was the turning point, and he decided to become an active participant
in keeping Singapore clean while inspiring others to do the same. “While
Singapore is clean, there’s always room for improvement”, quips Sanjay.</p>
<p>While there have been improvements, there have also been bumps in the
journey to educating others on public hygiene and cleanliness. Sanjay shared
that youths in particular, perhaps due to their more rebellious nature,
are harder to win over. Despite the challenges, Sanjay managed to touch
their hearts by showing them the negative impact of unsanitary public spaces
in Singapore, and how this could pose a public health threat to all of
us. He explains: “When you show them places that are heavily littered,
they realise that this is not how they want Singapore to be.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>With 2024 designated as the Year of Public Hygiene by the Ministry of
Sustainability and the Environment, Sanjay hopes that more residents will
realise the importance of maintaining public hygiene and cleanliness of
our shared spaces, and will appreciate our cleaning workforce who work
quietly and diligently to keep Singapore clean.</p>
