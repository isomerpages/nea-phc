<p>Singapore has come a long way in our public hygiene journey, and the collective
efforts of the Government, our people, the industry and other stakeholders,
have been pivotal in transforming Singapore into a city boasting high levels
of public hygiene.</p>
<p>Sustaining high levels of public hygiene requires all of us to play a
part. The Year of Public Hygiene goes beyond just stepping up on enforcement
efforts. Businesses, the community as well as individuals, can also play
an active part in upkeeping good public hygiene practices for our collective
well-being.</p>
<p>In support of the Year of Public Hygiene, we will be focusing our efforts
across the following areas to make Singapore truly clean and hygienic:</p>

<h3>Tackling Cleanliness Hotspots</h3>
<p>To maintain clean public spaces, the PHC will work closely with local
stakeholders to enhance community involvement and strengthen community
ownership for the cleanliness of common spaces.</p>

<h3>Tackling Unhygienic Public Toilets</h3>
<p>Cleanliness of public toilets remains challenging, and we can collectively
do more to enhance levels of cleanliness and hygiene, to provide a safe
and healthy environment for all.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment will set up a Public
Toilets Taskforce to review ways to improve cleanliness of poorer performing
public toilets, in particular toilets at coffeeshops and hawker centres.
It will also develop measures to improve hygiene standards for all public
toilets, including infrastructure, cleaning and public education. The Taskforce
will be co-chaired by Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability
and the Environment, Mr Baey Yam Keng, and Chairman of the PHC, Mr Andrew
Khng.</p>

<h3>Rallying the Community</h3>
<p>We will continue to work with our partners to empower all Singaporeans
to upkeep good hygiene practices for the betterment of our society.</p>
<p>The PHC will also launch the latest edition of the annual Keep Singapore
Clean Campaign on 28 April this year to rally the community to collectively
keep Singapore clean and green.</p>
