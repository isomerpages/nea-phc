<p>The 56-year-old’s journey as a green advocate began rather spontaneously,
when he decided to participate in a street clean-up by Green Bird – a non-profit
environmental group originating from Tokyo – over a decade ago. The group’s
vision was simply to clean the town they love and live in, and this resonated
with Siew Keong.</p>
<p>As a firm believer that public cleanliness is a collective responsibility
and an ongoing effort, Siew Keong has been dedicating his weekends to cleaning
up designated beaches in Singapore with fellow enthusiasts from coastal
clean-up group <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/sgbeachwarriors/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SG Beach Warriors</a>,
over the past five years.</p>
<p>Beyond the typical plastic bags and straws, Siew Keong focuses on removing
deeply embedded marine trash and heavy items, such as mattresses, helmets,
long thick ropes and even electrical appliances, from our shores!&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Siew Keong and his team marvel at what they uncover during their
clean-ups, this is also an indication of their ongoing impactful work to
take care of our environment, and shows how every action can contribute
towards the vision of a clean Singapore.</p>
<p>With 2024 designated as the Year of Public Hygiene by the Ministry of
Sustainability and the Environment, Siew Keong hopes that his role in working
alongside volunteers from all walks of life will inspire and inculcate
the importance of maintaining high levels of public cleanliness and hygiene
amongst the younger generation, to ensure that Singapore remains a pleasant
place to live, work and play in, for years to come.</p>

<p>His work doesn’t end here though. Siew Keong also participates in the
‘food rescue’ initiative, where he collects food items on the verge of
expiry and redistributes these to the community using the mobile app
<a href="https://www.goodhoodsg.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Good Hood</a>, to help reduce food waste.</p>
<p>Siew Keong’s unyielding passion and hard work is a testimony of how one
man’s efforts can drive meaningful change in the community and for the
environment.
