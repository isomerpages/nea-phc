<h3><strong>The keep Singapore clean love story</strong></h3>
<p>On the surface, Aung Myo Hein is a reserved and mild-mannered guy, spending
most of his days at Pulau Bukom as a project engineer. However, if you
ask him what he does on his only day off in the week, you will see his
demeanour change and his face light up with joy.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old has been an active volunteer and environmental advocate
since his days at university. After moving to Singapore in 2020, Aung’s
friends invited him to participate in clean-up activities organised by
the Green and Clean Volunteers Group – a member of the Public Hygiene Council
(PHC)’s R.I.S.E Champions Network.</p>
<p>It was during one of these occasions that he met his fiancée, Aye Thet
Mon Win, who shares the same passion for the environment as he does. The
couple did not have much opportunity to interact at first, as they were
assigned to different teams. However, Aung finally plucked up the courage
to ask for her social media contact from a mutual friend. The couple eventually
went out on dates, with many of these being volunteering events to care
for the environment.</p>

</p>
<p>Aung shares that the work he is passionate about does not come without
challenges. He has encountered negative reactions from members of the public
during clean-up activities, such as on one occasion at Fort Canning Park
when an inebriated man berated him and called him a disturbance.</p>
<p>However, with a smile on his face, Aung refuses to be discouraged. It
also helps that his fiancée is on this meaningful journey with him.</p>
<p>With 2024 designated as the Year of Public Hygiene by the Ministry of
Sustainability and the Environment, Aung hopes that more people will come
to experience the value and joy in volunteering, and understand the power
that each one of us has when we take simple steps to care for our environment.</p>
