<h3><strong>Beyond the Classroom:&nbsp; A Teacher's Passion for a Cleaner Singapore</strong></h3>
<p>Inspired by Singapore's reputation as a clean and green city, 57-year-old
teacher Mdm Suhani is committed to preserving its pristine image. Her dedication
extends beyond her HDB flat and classrooms into the heart of her community.</p>
<p>Her journey began when she participated in a school-organised beach clean-up.
This experience ignited a passion for public cleanliness and a strong sense
of accountability. She firmly believes that "public cleanliness is a shared
responsibility we should not take for granted," and hopes to encourage
others to join the cause.</p>
