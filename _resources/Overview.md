<h3>CleanPod</h3>
<p>On the yearly average, there are 700 over clean-ups at recreational beaches.
With the increased frequency of ad-hoc clean-ups, more tools and materials
are purchased by the communities by for activities. These new tools and
materials are often under-utilised, with an average of only 1 to 2 hours
of utility before being store away or disposed of.

<h3>Keep Singapore Clean Movement in Schools</h3>
<p><a href="/files/Resources/phc_nea_keep_singapore_clean_movement.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Keep Singapore Clean Movement in Schools’ educational resource pack</a>&nbsp;incorporates
relevant information and educational materials collated from various sources,
targeted at Pre-school, Primary and Secondary level. It serves as an essential
handbook for the students, parents and teachers.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The Keep Singapore Clean Movement (KSCM) in Schools is a student-driven
and school-supported effort for students to take ownership of the cleanliness
of their school and the environment. It was launched by the Ministry of
Education (MOE) in July 2014 and supported by the Public Hygiene Council
(PHC).</p>
<p>In line with the KSCM in Schools, ‘Buddy Clean Workshop’, a capacity building
programme titled to assist schools to educate students on the importance
of keeping their school clean as well as to train them in the various skills
(e.g. teamwork, communication) required for the cleaning activities. It
is an environment-based Values-In-Action (VIA) programme targeting at the&nbsp;<strong>Primary 3 and 4 students</strong>,
which schools can take up to fulfil the Character &amp; Citizenship curriculum.</p>
<h4>Buddy Clean Workshop</h4>
<p>The Buddy Clean Workshop is based on NEA’s programme – Project Buddy Clean,
which aims to inculcate positive social values and norms on cleanliness
amongst students. The project leveraged peer influence and feedback to
shape the behaviour of students. It also helps to foster shared ownership
and responsibility of common spaces through regular cohort-wide cleaning.

Resource Kit which consists of lessons plans to implement the project,

<p><strong>The Buddy Clean Workshop comprises of three key components and learning outcomes:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are introduced to the consequences of littering and the need
to keep their school clean and&nbsp;undergo discussion on the role of cleaners
to develop empathy and respect for them.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>2. Capacity Building</strong>
</p>
<p>Students undergo activities to learn how to communicate effectively, listen
actively and work together as a team to keep the school clean and&nbsp;learn
the various cleaning skills (e.g. how to sweep, mop) to conduct hands-on
cleaning activities in school.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>3. Discussion and Reflection</strong>
</p>
<p>Students discuss their group’s performance and reflect on what they have
learnt and the areas of improvement.</p>
