<p>Co-chaired by Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and the
Environment, Mr Baey Yam Keng and PHC Chairman, Mr Andrew Khng, the Public
Toilet Taskforce (PTTF) was established in Mar 2024 to study and recommend
solutions to improve the cleanliness of public toilets in Singapore. Through
working with stakeholders, including coffeeshop operators and owners, industry
experts, academics and the relevant agencies, the Taskforce has made 10
recommendations to uplift the standards of our public toilets.</p>
