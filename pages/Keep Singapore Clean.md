<h2>Keep Singapore Clean</h2>
<p>Every year, the Public Hygiene Council (PHC) holds our flagship initiative,
the Keep Singapore Clean (KSC) campaign, to raise awareness on the problem
of littering and to nudge Singapore residents to uphold higher standards
of hygiene and cleanliness in their everyday lives.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, the PHC has been emphasising our efforts towards
engaging students, youths and young families to encourage them to do their
part for the environment. Their participation could take various forms,
such as always binning trash responsibly, returning our crockery back to
the tray return stations after meals, and keeping the school and public
toilets clean and dry.</p>
<p>The PHC has engaged agency partners to systematically develop and implement
strategic communications campaigns on various platforms, including delivering
public messages through mainstream news media.&nbsp; Please refer to our&nbsp;

<summary>Frequently Asked Questions</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<h4><strong>1. Who will be involved?</strong></h4>
<p>Everyone. The Public Hygiene Council (PHC) has extended invitation to
our supporters and partners of the KSC partners (i.e. schools, businesses,
communities and organisations) to identify a location and lead activities
in the month of KSC. Public members are welcomed to organise or participate
in any activities to show their support for KCS.</p>
<h4><strong>2. Where are the activities held?</strong></h4>
<p>Organisers may identify and target any shared community places such as
residential estates, schools, parks, hawker centres and etc., to conduct
the clean-up activities.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>3. When are the activities held?</strong></h4>
<p>Organisers are welcomed to conduct their activities on any day between
28 Apr and 2 Jun 2024.</p>
<h4><strong>4. What if we are unable to commit any day in KCS month?</strong></h4>
<p>Keeping Singapore Clean is a lifetime commitment and not just a one-day
effort. We welcome groups and individuals to initiate their own programmes
to encourage and educate good practices at shared community spaces. Through
such sustained efforts, communities will take greater ownership to improve
the cleanliness and hygiene conditions of these public spaces.
